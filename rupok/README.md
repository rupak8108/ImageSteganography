# Steganography
C# Windows Forms application to apply steganography to image and audio files

* Hide text or files inside pictures or wav files
* Using LSB algorithm for wav files and a variation of LSB for images to increase file size limit
* Can use two random algorithms with different performances and the linear algorithm which is the fastest
* Text is encrypted with AES, files are ciphered with random xor cipher algorithm (https://github.com/rubendal/File-Cipher)
* No external libraries used!

## To Do:

* Improve file ciphering (https://github.com/rubendal/File-Cipher)
* Improve performance of random algorithm
